#### Why?

Using aptly via REST API allows to achieve two goals:

1. Remote access to aptly service: e.g. uploading packages and publishing them from CI server.
2. Concurrent access to aptly by multiple users.

#### Quickstart

Run `aptly api serve` to start HTTP service:

    $ aptly api serve
    Starting web server at: :8080 (press Ctrl+C to quit)...
    [GIN-debug] GET   /api/version              --> github.com/aptly-dev/aptly/api.apiVersion (4 handlers)
    ...

By default aptly would listen on `:8080`, but it could be changed with `-listen` flag.

Usage:

    $ aptly api serve -listen=:8080

Flags:

-   `-listen=":8080"`: host:port for HTTP listening
-   `-no-lock`: don't lock the database

When `-no-lock` option is enabled, API server acquires and drops the lock
around all the operations, so that API and CLI could be used concurrently.

Try some APIs:

    $ curl http://localhost:8080/api/version
    {"Version":"0.9~dev"}

    $ curl -F file=@aptly_0.8_i386.deb http://localhost:8080/api/files/aptly_0.8
    ["aptly_0.8/aptly_0.8_i386.deb"]

    $ curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data '{"Name": "aptly-repo"}' http://localhost:8080/api/repos
    {"Name":"aptly-repo","Comment":"","DefaultDistribution":"","DefaultComponent":""}

    $ curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/repos/aptly-repo/file/aptly_0.8
    {"failedFiles":[],"report":{"warnings":[],"added":["aptly_0.8_i386 added"],"removed":[]}}

    $ curl http://localhost:8080/api/repos/aptly-repo/packages
    ["Pi386 aptly 0.8 966561016b44ed80"]

    $ curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data '{"Distribution": "wheezy", "Sources": [{"Name": "aptly-repo"}]}' http://localhost:8080/api/publish//repos
    {"Architectures":["i386"],"Distribution":"wheezy","Label":"","Origin":"","Prefix":".","SourceKind":"local","Sources":[{"Component":"main","Name":"aptly-repo"}],"Storage":""}

#### Security

For security reasons it is advised to let Aptly listen on a Unix domain socket
rather than a port. Sockets are subject to file permissions and thus allow for
user-level access control while binding to a port only gives host-level access
control. To use a socket simply run Aptly with a suitable listen flag such as
`aptly api serve -listen=unix:///var/run/aptly.sock`.

Aptly's HTTP API shouldn't be directly exposed to the Internet: there's no
authentication/protection of APIs. To publish the API it could be proxied
through a HTTP proxy or server (e.g. nginx) to add an authentication mechanism
or disallow all non-GET requests. [Reference example](https://github.com/sepich/nginx-ldap) for LDAP based per-repo access with nginx.

#### Notes

1. Some things (for example, S3 publishing endpoints) could be set up only using configuration file, so it requires
   restart of aptly HTTP server in order for changes to take effect.
1. GPG key passphrase can't be input on console, so either passwordless GPG keys are required or passphrase should be specified in
   API parameters.
1. Some script might be required to start/stop aptly HTTP service.
1. Some parameters are given as part of URLs, which requires proper url encoding. Unfortunately, at the moment it's not possible
   to pass URL arguments with `/` in them.
