File Upload API
---------------

Upload package files temporarily to aptly service. These files
could be added to local repositories using [local repositories API](/doc/api/repos).

All uploaded files are stored under `<rootDir>/upload` directory (see [configuration](/doc/configuration)).
This directory would be created automatically if it doesn't exist.

Uploaded files are grouped by directories to support concurrent uploads from multiple
package sources. Local repos add API can operate on directory (adding all files from directory) or
on individual package files. By default, all successfully added package files would be removed.
