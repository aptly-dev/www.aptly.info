                <p class="small">aptly version 0.4 has been released today. Major feature in this version is local package repository management which allows to manage collection of your own packages, publish, take snapshots, mix with upstream repositories mirrors. Please download it or install from source, raise issues, disscuss in aptly-discuss group, follow me (@smira) to get information about updates. Other features in 0.4 worth mentioning are: support for source packages for mirrors and local repositories, ability to delete unused package files and DB entries, and memory usage optimizations.</p></li>

                <p class="small">Next aptly version (0.4) would contain some changes to lower memory requirements while doing general operations: memory usage will be decreased by factor of 3. aptly is written in Go language, so this is a short story of optimizing Go program memory usage. When I have been developing aptly, I suspected that memory usage would be not optimal, as aptly is processing huge amounts of package metadata (for example, when mirroring upstream Debian repositories consisting of 30000 packages).</p></li>

                <p class="small">Today I&rsquo;ve released aptly version 0.3. It&rsquo;s the first version I would recommend for production usage. Please download it or install from source, raise issues, disscuss in aptly-discuss group, follow me (@smira) to get information about updates. New features: using aptly serve command you can quickly serve your published repositories over HTTP, aptly would even advise right settings for apt sources; aptly checks signatures and verifies checksums for downloaded files while mirroring remote repositories, if you don&rsquo;t have key that was used to sign the mirror in your trusted GnuPG keychain, aptly would give some hints, some hints; flat format of Debian repositories is now supported (e.g.</p></li>
